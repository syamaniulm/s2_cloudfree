# Sentinel-2 SR Cloud/Shadow-free Project<br />

Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance cloud/shadow-free large imagery generation using JupyterLab and Google Earth Engine. These codes are intended to be executed in the JupyterLab environment installed on the user's computer, not in the Google Coolab cloud environment. If these codes are to be executed in Google Colab, then slight modifications have to be made to the codes.<br />

These codes are a modification of the Sentinel-2 Cloud Masking with s2cloudless (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/sentinel-2-s2cloudless).<br />
